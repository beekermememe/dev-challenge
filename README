===========================
Dev-Challenge

This code was written as part of a code challenge. I needed to return

1) Most improved batting average( hits / at-bats) from 2009 to 2010.  Only include players with at least 200 at-bats.
2) Slugging percentage for all players on the Oakland A's (teamID = OAK) in 2007. 
3) Who was the AL and NL triple crown winner for 2011 and 2012.  If no one won the crown, output "(No winner)"

===========================

To Run:
* bundle
* ruby -Ilib lib/runner.rb

To Run Specs (should include coverage data):
* rspec

Some comments

(1) I did not use a DB of any type.
(2) I try not to use obscure ruby tricks, they may be neat but can obscure what you are doing.
(3) My main thought was to decouple some of the more complex operations (Triple Crown and Improved logic) into their own classes instead of overloading the player/team classes.
(4) I did not do any performance tuning and there are probably a number of areas that we could hit but for the moment it works and is not too slow.
(5) Used simpleCov to make sure I was ok with coverage. There are some classes that could do with some extra love but overall pretty good.
